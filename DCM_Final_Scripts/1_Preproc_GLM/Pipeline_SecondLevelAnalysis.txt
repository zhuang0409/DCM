Single-Case GLM Analysis pipeline: Second-level Analysis (group of subjects)

1. Factorial design specification: 
choose the one-sample T-test to extract the mean group activation for a specific contrast of interest.
Data: select the specific contrast for all subject, to extract the mean activation of the group

From SPM blog:
The difference between the images is that the con image gives you the p-value at each voxel, while the spmT image gives you the t-statistic at each voxel.  
The functionality is the same as in regular null hypothesis significance testing.  The t-statistic accounts for the difference in observed Beta relative to standard error of the Betas.  The p-value tells you the statistical significance at each voxel; therefore, it accounts for the t-statistic at each voxel as well as the degrees of freedom of the data.
P.S. when you do a second-level analysis, you should always use the con files, not the spmT's

2. Model estimation: dependency with the previous SPM.mat created, to estimate the model and extract the mean activation.
