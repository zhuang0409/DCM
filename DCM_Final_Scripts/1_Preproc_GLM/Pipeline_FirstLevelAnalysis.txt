Single-Case GLM Analysis pipeline: First-level analysis -> concatenation of runs, to be able then to perform the PPI and DCM analysis that need to have only 1 run.

1. fMRI model Specification: all runs of one subject (within-subject analysis)

- Units for design: seconds

- Interscan interval: TR (2sec)

- Microtime resolution: number of time-bind per scan (leave the default value). This value can correspond to the number of slices insert in the slice-time correction, if applied. Our value= 34

- Microtime onset: time of the first time-bin (don't change the default value unless you have a long TR). This value can correspong to the reference slice set in the slice-time correction. 
In our case, it is the middle slice= 17. Our value= 17.

- Multiple conditions: enter the conditions.mat file created in the folder of each subject/each run, where there are all the informations concering name, onset and durations of conditions.

- Multiple regressors: load the .txt file created during the realignment (in the preprocessing) with the information concernign motion artifacts [realigment parameters].

- High-pass filtering: in the original paper the threshold applied was 3cycles per run [BrainVoyager] - https://www.brainvoyager.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000383.html
To calculate the corresponding cut-off frequency in Hz, you just have to multiply the number of volumes in your run with the TR (in seconds) to obtain the total run length in seconds.
Then you divide the number of cycles through this number to obtain the frequency of the filter in Hz.

TR = 2000 ms (2 secs)
133 volumes measured
3 cycles HP filter applied

133 * 2 = 266 secs
3/266 = 0.011 Hz

From this frequency, is possible to calculate the corresponding seconds of threshold by doing:
f = 0.011Hz
f=1/sec
sec=1/f -> 1/0.011 => 90sec

So, the final filter applied is 90sec.

- Basis functions: Canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), combined with time and disperios derivatives. NO derivatives applied

- Global normalisation: SPM can normalise fMRI data in one of two ways. These are selected using the options ‘None’ (the default) and ‘Scaling’. Chosen: NONE

- Explicit mask: use the segmentation of structural images to specify the within-brain mask or don't use any mask.NO mask applied

- Serial correlations: Serial correlations in fMRI time series due to aliased biorhythms and unmodelled neuronal activity
can be accounted for using an autoregressive AR(1) model during Classical (ReML) parameter
estimation. This estimate assumes the same correlation structure for each voxel, within each session.
ReML estimates are then used to correct for non-sphericity during inference by adjusting the
statistics and degrees of freedom appropriately. The discrepancy between estimated and actual
correlations are greatest at low frequencies. Therefore specification of the high-pass filter is
particularly important.
Serial correlation can be ignored if you choose the “none” option. Note that the above options
only apply if you later specify that your model will be estimated using the Classical (ReML) ap-
proach. If you choose Bayesian estimation these options will be ignored. For Bayesian estimation,
the choice of noise model (AR model order) is made under the estimation options.  Chosen: AR(1)

2. fMRI nodel estimation: estimate the SPM.mat from the model previously specified.

3. Contrasts manager: creation of the contrast including all runs for each participant.
List of conditions:
Action A: cutting / Action B: peeling
Object A: apple / Object B: potato
Task A: action task / Task B: object task

- All conditions (T and F maps): all conditions vs baseline
- Task-based contrasts: action (TaskA) and object (Task B) tasks vs baseline -> 11110000000000; 00001111000000
- Action-based contrasts: cutting (Action A) and peeling (Action B) actions vs baseline
- Object-based contrasts: apple (Object A) and potato (Object B) objects vs baseline
