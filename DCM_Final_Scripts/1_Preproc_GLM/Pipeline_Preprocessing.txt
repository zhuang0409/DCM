1. Realign: ESTIMATE AND RESLICE
Realign is the most basic function to match images. It uses a rigid body transformation
to manipulate the scans. This means that it allows only translations (moving the
image in X, Y, or Z direction) and rotations (over the X, Y, and Z axis). By trial and
error it tries to find the manipulation that minimizes the difference between two
scans. The cost function that is minimized is the sum of squared differences
between the two scans. As a consequence, it can only be used within modalities,
i.e., on scans that have been acquired with the same pulse sequence. It is mostly
used to correct for motion of the subject during the functional scans (hence the
name realign). Realignment results in changes to the (affine) transformation that is
incorporated into your “.nii” files. You can also “reslice” these images into new files
containing altered (interpolated) bitmaps.
The same realignement has been performed with all the runs together, in order to realign all the functional images
to the first image of the first run.
Realign: trilinear interpolation;
Reslice: 4th Degree - Realign all images + the mean image.

2. Slice Time correction: DEPENDENCTY -> REALIGNED IMAGES
Most functional pulse sequences (like 2D EPI, as opposed to three dimensional
pulse sequences such as 3D EPI or PRESTO) do not acquire every slice in a volume
at the same moment. Because the time it takes to scan a volume is typically in
the order of seconds, substantial timing differences can occur as a function of
acquisition order of the slices within a scan. In fMRI models where timing is an
important factor (i.e., in event related designs), this timing difference should therefore
be taken into account. SPM solves this problem by allowing the opportunity to
correct (i.e., equalize) the timing of your functional series.

3. Coregistration: ESTIMATE
The Coregister function is used to match scans of different modalities.
Reference: mean image created with the realignement -> DEPENDENCY MEAN REALIGNEMENT (one mean image for all the runs together)
Source: T1-weighted image

4. Segmentation: DEPENDENCY -> COREGISTERED IMAGES (T1 modified after the coregistration)
Segment can be used to separate tissue classes such as grey matter, white matter,
CSF, in anatomical scans. Segmenting an anatomical scan thus results in a set of
different images, which can be used, e.g., for varying purposes, such as volumetry
(voxel based morphometry). Segmentation is also used for normalization.

5a. Normalization for functional data: WRITE / DEPENDENCY -> SLICE TIME CORRECTED IMAGES -> one normalization for each run of the same subject
The Normalize function is used to manipulate scans into standard stereotactic (MNI)
space. MNI space as used in SPM12 is defined by a template that was created by
nonlinear registration of 152 T1-weighted images.
Normalize by using T1 image unified segmentation: structural image was coregistered to the mean functional image after the motion correction (coregistration); 
The transformed structural image was then segmented into gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid by using a unified segmentation algorithm (segmentation). 
The motion corrected functional volumes were spatially normalized to the MNI space using the normalization parameters estimated during unified segmentation (normalization).
- Voxel sizes: Next, you may alter the voxel size of your new scans. By default, SPM will reslice
your new normalized images at a voxel size of 2*2*2 mm. In some circumstances, it
is advisable to change this setting to your original voxel size or the closest round
number. Smaller voxels will substantially increase the size of your dataset and the
time required for statistical calculations, but may be beneficial for smoothness estimations
that SPM uses for multiple comparisons corrections.
Also, make sure your voxels fit into the bounding box. For instance, 4*4*4 voxels fit
into a -80 to 80,-112 to 76, -68 to 88] bounding box, because all these boundaries
can be devided by four.

To normalize to the MNI space, to be able to use then the output in fsleyes/fslutils, use the following bounding box:
[-90 -126 -72; 90 90 108] -> https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1909&L=SPM&P=R975 -> MY CHOICE
or apply the following procedure -> https://www.researchgate.net/post/Does_SPM12_Segment_generate_output_in_MNI_space

5b. Normalization for structural data: WRITE / DEPENDENCY -> SEGMENT:BIAS CORRECTED

6. Smoothing: DEPENDENCY -> NORMALIZED IMAGES -> one smoothing for each run of the same subject
The Smooth function is used as a final step in spatial pre-processing to blur the
functional images. The reason to do this is to correct for slight remaining functional/
anatomical differences between subjects. The trade-off, however, is that you lose
resolution by smoothing. Thus, the amount of smoothing that you should use is
determined partly by the question you want answered. When you are interested in
very small structures, for instance, you should not use much smoothing.
